# Operating-System---PROJECT
In this project I have design a scheduler that uses a preemptive priority scheduling algorithm based on dynamically changing priority. We know that Larger number for priority indicates higher priority so according to that Iâ€™ve to solve problem. For that I have given processes with arrival time and service time to understand the problem.
